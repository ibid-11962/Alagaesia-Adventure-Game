        <p>-Use the suggested commands and directions below to complete tasks. The list is <em>not comprehensive</em>, so
            in places where none of the listed commands will work, read the surrounding descriptions carefully. If you
            get stuck, try different commands or ask for a hint.</p>
        <p>-Use directional commands (north, south, etc.) to navigate throughout the game.</p>
        <p>-Use the "look at" command to describe any object mentioned in the game. Answers are often hidden in the
            descriptions.</p>
        <p>-When in doubt, try to "take" any objects you encounter, as you may need them later on!</p>
        <p>-Keep a pad and pencil on hand and try sketching your path through the game if you get lost.</p>
